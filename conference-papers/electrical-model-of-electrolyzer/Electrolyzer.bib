Based on the literature review this paper presents an open-source MATLAB toolbox for water electrolyzer polarisation curve parametrization and modelling.

As real-world measurement data is rarely ideal, tests were also conducted using suboptimal data, first with data sets that have a low number of measurement points and secondly with data sets that have low or high current densities missing.

  abstract = {The principle of the electrochemical decomposition of water in an electrolysis cell has already been known for more than 230 years. The first generation of hydrogen by electricity was done as early as 1789 by van Troostwijk and Deiman using an electrostatic generator as the direct current source. Shortly after Volta invented the voltaic pile in 1800, Carlisle and Nicholson used such a device to decompose water into hydrogen and oxygen. In the same year, Ritter performed comparable experiments in Jena, Germany. Moreover, Cruickshank used a voltaic pile for the electrochemical decomposition of NaCl to hydrogen and chlorine at the beginning of the 19th century. Nevertheless, it took decades before the processes were used in the first technical applications. Around 1890 Charles Renard constructed a water electrolysis unit to generate hydrogen for French military airships. It is estimated that around 1900 more than 400 industrial alkaline water electrolyzers were in operation worldwide and large-scale deployment of the chlor-alkali process started. Later, different types of commercial alkaline water electrolyzers were developed in the 20th century to generate hydrogen needed to produce ammonia fertilizers based on low-cost hydroelectricity. As the 20th century progressed, the more cost-effective production of hydrogen by steam reforming of methane increasingly replaced water electrolysis, and by the end of the 20th century, the process was only used in niche applications. In the late 1960s the development of proton exchange membrane electrolysis began at General Electric using an acidic fluorinated ionomer as a solid electrolyte. But the technology became established in the following decades only in laboratory, military, and space applications due to the high material costs. At about the same time, General Electric, and the Brookhaven National Laboratory also started to develop high-temperature electrolysis with solid oxide cells. In Germany, Dornier followed in the HOT ELLY project this technology until the mid-1980s. But despite of all technical progress made commercialization of the membrane and solid oxide electrolysis could not be launched in that time. But new interest in water electrolysis was stimulated already in the 1990s as hydrogen was regarded as a green energy carrier for renewable energy sources like wind and solar power and to power fuel cells, e.g., in automotive applications. However, it is only in the last 10 years that we have seen a significant increase in global interest for water electrolysis, with the adoption of ambitious national climate protection programs. Water electrolysis is regarded as the central element for sector coupling and is expected to make an important contribution to reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions close to net-zero by 2050.}

  abstract = {This paper analyses the permanent and transient behaviour of a 1Nm3h−{1} commercial advanced alkaline water electrolyser and develops a complete and integrated static–{dynamic} electrical model that can be applied to any commercial water electrolyser. The model is based on the thermodynamic, activation, double-layer and ohmic effects and phenomena that take place in a real alkaline electrolysis process. The parameters of the model are experimentally determined from both static and dynamic operating tests to the electrolyser. Based on these tests, the electrical behaviour of the electrolyser has been characterized, concluding that, at operating conditions of 45°C and 25bar, the cell area-specific resistance is 0.431Ωcm2 and the cell specific double-layer capacitances are 0.0467Fcm−2 for the anodic interface and 2.25×10−3Fcm−2 for the cathodic interface. The model has been implemented on MATLAB-Simulink® and validated in three different operating environments: at static operation by means of the I–V characteristic curves; at dynamic operation by means of a sinusoidal current of various amplitudes and frequencies superimposed to a DC current; and by using two power supplies with different conversion topologies, the first one harmonic free and the other with a high harmonic content. As it will be shown in the paper, the model simulations reproduce with a high accuracy the experimental electrical behaviour of the electrolyser.}

  abstract = {This work presents a multi-physics model used for the design and diagnosis of the alkaline electrolyzers. The model is based on a new approach that allows to choose precisely the design parameters of a new electrolyzer even if it is not commercially available and predicting energy consumption, efficiency and rate of hydrogen production, taking into account to their physical state and various operating conditions. The approach differs from those of conventional models of the following: It allows the characterization of the electrolyzer based on its structural parameters in a relatively short time (few minutes) compared with the conventional approach which need experimental data collected for few weeks (Ulleberg). The approach allows describing a range of alkaline electrolyzers, while semi-empirical models found in literature are inherent to a specific electrolyzer. In addition, the model takes into account the variation of all structural parameters (geometry, materials and their evolution depending on operating conditions) and operational parameters of the electrolyzer (temperature, pressure, concentration, bulk bubbling and recovery rate of electrode surface by the bubble), while the models in the literature involve only the temperature. The developed multi-physics model was programmed in a Matlab Simulink® environment and an alkaline electrolyzer’s simulation tool was developed. The simulation tool was validated using two industrial (Stuart and Phoebus) electrolyzers with different structures and power rates. Simulation results reproduced experimental data with good accuracy (less than 0.9%). The simulation tool was also used to compare the energy efficiency of two hydrogen production systems. The first one is based on atmospheric electrolyzer with a compressor for hydrogen storage and the second one is a barometric electrolyzer (under pressure) with its auxiliary devices to identify the effective mode of hydrogen production according to the physical state and operating conditions of the electrolyzer. The analysis of results revealed that the second mode of hydrogen production is more efficient and confirms the results of the literature based solely on the thermodynamic approach (K. Onda et al) without the input of the power consumed by power overvoltages.}

  abstract = {The performance of a 6kW proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolyzer was modeled using a semiempirical equation. Total cell voltage was represented as a sum of the Nernst voltage, activation overpotential and ohmic overpotential. A temperature and pressure dependent Nernst potential, derived from thermodynamic principles, was used to model the 20 cell PEM electrolyzer stack. The importance of including the temperature dependence of various model components is clearly demonstrated. The reversible potential without the pressure effect decreases with increasing temperature in a linear fashion. The exchange current densities at both the electrodes and the membrane conductivity were the coefficients of the semiempirical equation. An experimental system designed around a 6kW PEM electrolyzer was used to obtain the current–voltage characteristics at different stack temperatures. A nonlinear curve fitting method was employed to determine the equation coefficients from the experimental current–voltage characteristics. The modeling results showed an increase in the anode and cathode exchange current densities with increasing electrolyzer stack temperature. The membrane conductivity was also increased with increasing temperature and was modeled as a function of temperature. The electrolyzer energy efficiencies at different temperatures were evaluated using temperature dependent higher heating value voltages instead of a fixed value of 1.48V.}

A new ohmic loss model of a PEM electrolyzer cell has been developed and the influence of different operating conditions and physical design parameters on its performance has been investigated, including operating temperature, pressure, exchange current density, electrode thickness, membrane thickness and interfacial resistance. The interfacial resistance between the membrane and electrode has been found to play an important part for electrolyzer performance and an overpotential is increased significantly with the interfacial resistance. At a current density of 1.5 A/cm2, the performance loss due to the interfacial resistance between the membrane and electrode comprises 31.8% of the total ohmic loss. Thickness changes in either electrode or membrane also have significant impacts on the electrolyzer performance mainly due to their contributions to the diffusion overpotential and ohmic loss. Increasing the operating temperature will result in lower electrolyzer overpotential, while increasing the operating pressure will lead to higher electrolyzer overpotential, which is mainly controlled by the open circuit voltage. Results obtained from the present model will provide a comprehensive understanding of design parameter effects and consequently improve the design/performance in a PEM electrolyzer cell.}

  Reaching high current densities is absolutely imperative for electrochemical energy conversion, from fuel cells to CO2 reduction. Here, we identify the existence of a performance indicator for gas-evolving electrochemical energy conversion devices: the critical current density. The critical current density pinpoints a performance inflection point whereby both the gas saturations and mass transport overpotentials suddenly dominate cell performance and exacerbate failure. We elucidate the mass transport behavior of a polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) water electrolyzer using in operando neutron imaging at operating current densities as high as 9 A ⋅ cm−2. Product gases become heterogeneously distributed in the porous transport layer adjacent to the catalyst layer and promote disastrous local hotspots. Optimizing new materials and cell architectures with this performance indicator may unlock higher than previously reported performances for electrochemical energy conversion.}

  abstract = {Hydrogen is the most efficient energy carrier. Hydrogen can be obtained from different sources of raw materials including water. Among many hydrogen production methods, eco-friendly and high purity of hydrogen can be obtained by water electrolysis. However, In terms of sustainability and environmental impact, PEM water electrolysis was considered as most promising techniques for high pure efficient hydrogen production from renewable energy sources and emits only oxygen as byproduct without any carbon emissions. Moreover, the produced hydrogen (H2) and oxygen (O2) directly used for fuel cell and industrial applications. However, overall water splitting resulting in only 4% of global industrial hydrogen being produced by electrolysis of water, mainly due to the economic issues. Nowadays, increased the desire production of green hydrogen has increased the interest on PEM water electrolysis. Thus the considerable research has been completed recently in the development of cost effective electrocatalysts for PEM water electrolysis. In this present review, we discussed about the recent developments in the PEM water electrolysis including high performance low cost HER and OER electrocatalysts and their challenges new and old related to electrocatalysts and PEM cell components also addressed. This review will contribute further research improvements and a road map in order to support in developing the PEM water electrolyser as a commercially feasible hydrogen production purpose.}

  abstract = {Hydrogen as an energy source has been identified as an optimal pathway for mitigating climate change by combining renewable electricity with water electrolysis systems. Proton exchange membrane (PEM) technology has received a substantial amount of attention because of its ability to efficiently produce high-purity hydrogen while minimising challenges associated with handling and maintenance. Another hydrogen generation technology, alkaline water electrolysis (AWE), has been widely used in commercial hydrogen production applications. Anion exchange membrane (AEM) technology can produce hydrogen at relatively low costs because the noble metal catalysts used in PEM and AWE systems are replaced with conventional low-cost electrocatalysts. Solid oxide electrolyzer cell (SOEC) technology is another electrolysis technology for producing hydrogen at relatively high conversion efficiencies, low cost, and with low associated emissions. However, the operating temperatures of SOECs are high which necessitates long startup times. This review addresses the current state of technologies capable of using impure water in water electrolysis systems. Commercially available water electrolysis systems were extensively discussed and compared. The technical barriers of hydrogen production by PEM and AEM were also investigated. Furthermore, commercial PEM stack electrolyzer performance was evaluated using artificial river water (soft water). An integrated system approach was recommended for meeting the power and pure water demands using reversible seawater by combining renewable electricity, water electrolysis, and fuel cells. AEM performance was considered to be low, requiring further developments to enhance the membrane's lifetime.}
