# 🌞 Summer Internship Documents — 2024

This repository contains **PLECS simulations**, **Beamer presentations**, and **IEEE-format reports** created during my **Summer Internship 2024** under **Professor Marko Hinkkanen** at Aalto University.

The internship focused on:

- Understanding the operating principles of **electrolysers**
- Developing intuition for their **equivalent impedance models**
- Studying different **power supply topologies** suitable for industrial-scale electrolyser systems
